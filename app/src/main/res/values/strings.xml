        Welcome to the wonderful world of Hedgehogs! My names Uncle Tapp, and we here at the Happy Scritches Hedgehog Sanctuary and thrilled to have you as our newest franchise owner, #24362 &lt;ERROR FINDING NAME&gt;

        As you\'ll remember from your mandatory training seminar, your job here is to wrangle up as many of these critters as you possibly can and send them back to Happy Scritches HQ. Once we receive them, they\'ll be &lt;POSITIVE ADJECTIVE&gt; &lt;PLEASANTRY&gt; in their new homes!
        Now that you\'re a part of the Happy Scritches family officially, you\'re authorized to hire your own employees and buy your own hedgehog-herding equipment. We\'ll be checking in from time to time to make sure you feel like you\'re still on track.

        Good luck, and
        \'Happy Hedgehogs\'
